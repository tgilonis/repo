We want to test that an alarm is raised, and also implement different alarm notification methods.
(For example: automatically call the fire department, call the owner’s phone, and trigger the control unit alarm siren.)
Plan how you can extract the announcement logic and:

a). Trigger many different announcement strategies.
b). Test that the different strategies was triggered.

Currently SecurityControlUnit extends NormalControlUnit (a concrete class). This needs to be changed:

- Create an abstract NormalControlUnit class that implements ControlUnit
- SecurityControlUnit will extend this abstract class, thus removing dependency inversion violation

Control Unit Triggers need to be specified:

- Create a file that can be read to find phone numbers specific to the emergency

Many factories being used:

- Create abstract factories to instantiate factory classes
